# Notes for Jan 27

### Current areas of investigation

Ordered by importance (ordering correct?)

 - Complete porting, 2to3 comparisons (added classes)
 - Cython comparison of more advanced programs (i.e. shedskin-chess). 
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does more advanced benchmarking look like? Mention sort of 1000 integers
 - Auta (example of high level language implementation) 
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems like a very feasible use of Progtran
 - Formal haskell stuff (AST-transform feature) 
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the haskell compiler is so advanced, is taking a generalized approach (Progtran) even appropriate?

### Paper

 Discuss above areas of investigation
 
 Comparison to similar projects
 
 Focus on feasibility of multi-language porting. There _are_ reasons it isn't usually done, but maybe these are less justified than previously thought?
 
 Research, general comments on Cython, 2to3
