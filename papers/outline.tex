\section{Abstract}
Progtran is an attempt to build a multi-language source-to-source compiler. Ideally, one will be able to convert programs in one language to programs in another without a loss in readability. This will allows for more user flexibility. For example, Python syntax is generally easier to understand than C++'s, but if one can translate Python to C++, then one can have both benefits. Progtran is an investigation into the feasibility of such conversions.
