# Compiler

A simple compiler:

[Matching](./docs/Match.md)  
[Parser](./docs/Parser.md)  
[Lexer](./docs/Lexer.md)  
[IO](./docs/IO.md)  

(Documentation for code gen and other features will be added as they become more robust)

Currently:

The existing compiler can convert something like:

[Input](./input/input.txt)

Into:

[Output](./output/output.cpp)
         
But is very brittle and only supports function definitions, simple expressions, assignment, and function calls.
